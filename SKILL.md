# Roots & Shoots Action Planning

Transform concern into concrete community action using Jane Goodall's proven four-step methodology: Get Engaged, Observe, Plan, Act. Every individual matters - and this is how individuals create change.

---

## When to Use

- User wants to make a difference but doesn't know how to start
- Feeling overwhelmed by the scale of a problem
- "I care about X but feel paralyzed"
- Converting concern, anger, or grief into constructive action
- Request for "how do I turn concern into action?" or "Roots & Shoots method"
- Youth empowerment or education contexts
- Community organizing or local action planning

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| issue | Yes | The cause or problem the user cares about |
| community_context | No | Where they live/work, community characteristics |
| resources | No | Time, money, skills, connections available |
| desired_impact | No | What change they hope to create |

---

## The Four-Step Framework

### Step 1: Get Engaged

Before acting, engage with the issue and with changemakers:

**Questions to explore:**
- Who is already working on this issue? What can you learn from them?
- What successful efforts exist locally, nationally, globally?
- What about this issue resonates with you personally?
- What does "making a difference" look like to you?

**Activities:**
- Research existing organizations and initiatives
- Talk to people already doing the work
- Read/watch/listen to understand the issue deeply
- Connect your personal story to the cause

**Goodall's insight:** "Every individual has a role to play." Your first step is understanding what role might be yours.

### Step 2: Observe (Community Mapping)

Use the community mapping technique from conservation science:

**Map your community for:**
- **Needs:** What specific problems exist in your local area related to this issue?
- **Assets:** What resources, skills, and people exist that could help?
- **Gaps:** What's missing? What's not being addressed?
- **Opportunities:** Where could action have the most impact?

**Create a simple map:**
| Category | What Exists | What's Needed | Who's Involved |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Community (people) | | | |
| Animals/Environment | | | |
| Resources/Infrastructure | | | |

**Key principle:** See what's actually there, not just what you assume.

### Step 3: Plan

Design a project that addresses identified needs:

**Project Design Questions:**
- What specific, achievable goal can you set?
- Who will benefit directly?
- What resources do you need? What do you have?
- Who can you partner with?
- What's a realistic timeline?
- How will you know if you succeed?

**The Three Domains:**
Roots & Shoots projects ideally address all three:
1. **People/Community** - How does this help humans?
2. **Animals** - How does this help other species?
3. **Environment** - How does this help ecosystems?

Even if your primary focus is one area, consider connections to the others.

**Project Template:**
```
Goal: [Specific, measurable outcome]
Beneficiaries: [Who benefits directly]
Timeline: [Realistic timeframe]
Resources needed: [What you need]
Resources available: [What you have]
Partners: [Who can help]
Success measure: [How you'll know it worked]
```

### Step 4: Act

Implement your plan and document impact:

**Action Principles:**
- Start small - a completed small project beats an abandoned big one
- Document what happens - photos, stories, data
- Reflect as you go - what's working? What needs adjustment?
- Share your successes - inspire others by showing what's possible
- Iterate - first projects lead to better second projects

**Remember:** "You cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around you. What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make."

## Constraints

- Keep projects realistic and achievable
- Emphasize starting small over ambitious failures
- Connect local action to broader impact without overpromising
- Respect the user's actual resources (time, energy, money)
- Encourage partnerships over solo heroics

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm really upset about plastic pollution in the ocean. I live in a landlocked city and feel like I can't do anything meaningful about it."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Roots & Shoots Action Plan

### The Issue
Plastic pollution in oceans - a global crisis that feels distant from a landlocked city. The feeling of powerlessness is understandable, but all water eventually flows to the sea.

### Step 1: Get Engaged
**Who to learn from:**
- Ocean Conservancy - runs International Coastal Cleanup, has inland partner programs
- 5 Gyres Institute - researches plastic pollution, has advocacy resources
- Surfrider Foundation - even has "Rise Above Plastics" chapters in landlocked areas

**Resources to explore:**
- Documentary: "A Plastic Ocean" (90 min, available streaming)
- Book: "Plastic: A Toxic Love Story" by Susan Freinkel
- Your local river keeper organization (rivers carry plastic to oceans)

**Personal connection:**
What is it about ocean plastic that moves you? Specific images, animals affected, the vastness of the problem? That emotional connection is fuel for sustained action.

### Step 2: Community Mapping
**Local needs identified:**
- Rivers and streams in your area carry plastic to distant oceans
- Local businesses use single-use plastics heavily
- Community awareness of plastic-ocean connection may be low
- Litter in waterways is visible and local

**Assets available:**
- Schools, churches, community groups that might partner
- Local government interest in clean waterways
- Your time and concern

**Gaps and opportunities:**
- No local group specifically focused on plastic reduction
- Restaurants still using styrofoam and plastic straws
- Kids in schools might be engaged by this issue

**Community Map:**
| Category | What Exists | What's Needed | Potential Partners |
|----------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|
| People | Awareness of littering | Understanding of river-ocean connection | Schools, Scout troops |
| Animals | Local wildlife affected by litter | Protection from plastic ingestion | Wildlife organizations |
| Environment | Rivers that flow to Gulf/Ocean | Reduced plastic entering waterways | River keepers, city parks dept |

### Step 3: Project Plan
**Goal:** Organize one river/stream cleanup that collects 50+ lbs of plastic and educates participants about the ocean connection.

**Beneficiaries:** Local waterway, wildlife that lives there, distant ocean ecosystems, participants who learn

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks to plan, one day to execute

**Resources:**
- Need: Cleanup supplies (bags, gloves), location permit, volunteer recruitment
- Have: Your time, passion, social connections

**Partners:**
- Local parks department (may provide supplies and permits)
- Scout troops or school groups looking for service projects
- Local environmental organizations

**Success measure:**
- 20+ volunteers participate
- 50+ lbs of plastic collected
- Each participant can explain how river plastic reaches the ocean

**Three-domain connection:**
- People: Education and community building; sense of agency
- Animals: Direct removal of hazards to local wildlife
- Environment: Cleaner waterway, less downstream pollution

### Step 4: Action Steps
1. **This week:** Contact local parks department about cleanup locations and permits
2. **Week 2:** Reach out to three potential partner organizations
3. **Week 3:** Choose date and location; create simple flyer
4. **Week 4:** Begin recruitment - social media, community boards, partner networks
5. **Week 5-6:** Confirm logistics, supplies, volunteers
6. **Week 7:** Host cleanup event; document with photos
7. **Week 8:** Share results, thank participants, plan next action

### How to Share Impact
- Photos of collected plastic with weight documented
- Post to social media with message connecting river cleanup to ocean health
- Write short piece for local paper or community newsletter
- Present to one school class about what you found and why it matters

### Remember
"What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make." Your landlocked city sits upstream of someone's coast. Every piece of plastic you prevent from entering the water is one less piece choking a sea turtle, one less fragment breaking down into microplastics. You are not distant from the ocean. You are connected to it by every waterway that flows through your community. Act locally, impact globally.
